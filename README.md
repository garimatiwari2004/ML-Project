# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction

This project focuses on **predicting student performance** based on various academic, demographic, and behavioral factors. The goal is to build a **machine learning model** that can help educators and institutions identify students who may need additional support.

## 📌 Features:
- **Data Preprocessing** 🔄: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 📊: Visualizing trends, correlations, and insights.
- **Machine Learning Models** 🤖: Training models like **Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost**, and **Neural Networks**.
- **Performance Metrics** 📈: Evaluating models using **accuracy, RMSE, R² score, and F1-score**.
- **Deployment** 🚀: Deploying the best model using ** Streamlit dashboard**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **Python** 🐍: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning** 🤖: Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
- **Model Deployment** 🌍: Flask/Django, Streamlit
